# init-recon

### Wrapper around findomain, subfinder, httpx, subzy, aquatone

I'll update this script as I progress in my learning and as per my necessities. <br>
There're tons of automation of recon tools but making your own gives a learning experience and motivating. <br>
And, also you know how to fix a bug/error __when__ it occurs

### Feel free to use or read the code to make/modify, whatever works!
